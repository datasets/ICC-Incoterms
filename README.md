# ICC-Incoterms

International Commercial Terms (‘Incoterms’) are internationally recognised standard trade terms used in sales contracts. They’re used to make sure buyer and seller know:

* who is responsible for the cost of transporting the goods, including insurance, taxes and duties
* where the goods should be picked up from and transported to
*who is responsible for the goods at each step during transportation

The current set of Incoterms is Incoterms 2010. A copy of the full terms is available from http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/incoterms-2010/
